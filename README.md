# Pathfinder 2E Oversights
A central listing of all the typos/oversights/potential errors/etc found in the initial books launched for Pathfinder 2E.

I try not to add too many things related more to just the rules being ambiguous, or otherwise FAQ candidates, in order to try and control the scope of this list.

## December 2020 Update
This list has been updated to remove the massive number of things that were successfully addressed in the Core Rulebook's 2nd printing after Errata #2.

## Core Rulebook
* `p.162` in sidebar: "Higher-Level Feats: **Mountain Stance (1st)**". Should be **Ki Strike (1st)**, as many of the other listed feats require it.
* `p.224` in Divine Breadth: "...other than your two highest **druid** spell slots." Should be **cleric**.
* `p.260` in Cloud Jump: "**You** unparalled athletic skill...". should be **Your**.
* `p.273` in Broken: "An object is broken when damage has reduced its Hit Points **below** its Broken Threshold". This feels inconsistent with page 272 where it says "when its Hit Points are **equal to or lower than**".
* `p.326` in Continual Flame: Heightened versions of the spell say what the gold cost increases are, but not what actual effect that comes with.
* `p.635` in rarity: "Anything that doesn't list a rarity is common. 13, **535, GM advice 534**". Should be **534, GM advice 488**.

## Bestiary

* `p.112` in Ancient Red Dragon: The size trait should be **Gargantuan** instead of **Huge**.
* `p.134` in Draconic Frenzy: "The frost drake makes two **gang Strikes**". Should be "**fang Strikes**".
* `p.150`: The Air Mephit has a +19 Reflex save. This is high to a statistically significant extent for a level 1 creature. See note at the bottom of this post.
* `p.157`: The Faerie Dragon has a +16 Perception. This is high to a statistically significant extent for a level 2 creature. See note at the bottom of this post.
* `p.174` in Storm Giant: **Sense Motive** is listed as one of its skills.
* `p.195`: Grikkitog says "Resistances 10 (except adamantine)". What kind of resistance? Physical? All?
* `p.208` in sidebar: "the crafting of a soulbound doll (page **306**)". Should be **304**.
* `p.255` in sidebar: The Shoggoth is listed as a variant ooze, though the Shoggoth doesn't have the Ooze trait. Also, the Shoggoth is listed as being on **p.297**, when it's on **p.293** instead.
* `p.293`: Constrict attack has no DC against it. Is this on purpose?
* `p.330` **Wolfsbane** sidebar and Core Rulebook Wolfsbane-entry (page 553) don't agree on effects of Wolfsbane on lycanthropy. (Allow re-save vs. curse for creatures not transformed yet vs. 'immediately cured of the lycanthropy')
* `p.340` in Zombie Abilities, Rotting Aura: "Any living creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the zombie and is not at full Hit Points takes 1d6 damage as its wounds fester". No damage type is specified, should probably be **negative**.
* `p.351`: "Skum" on page 12 are not included in the index by level.
* `p.355`: The Pixie is listed as being on p.**310**. It should say **309**. 

## Character Sheet Pack

* Many of the fighter's odd-level class features were misprinted in their even-level class feat boxes, making those boxes unusable.

## Other Notes/FAQ Candidates

* Looks like by RAW, you could grapple, trip, etc, swarms. Pulling back on the harsh rles from PF1e is great at least.

* In the Bestiary, many monsters have the Constrict ability, which says that creatures can attempt a basic Fortitude save with "the listed DC", but many of the creatures with this ability don't list a DC.
